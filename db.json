The song\u2019s vocoder-heavy vocals reinforce its mechanical theme, making it a staple in electronic and dance music. Its influence extended beyond the EDM scene, with Kanye West famously sampling it for his hit Stronger in 2007. Over two decades after its release, the track remains an iconic symbol of Daft Punk\u2019s impact on electronic music and digital production.",

The track\u2019s hard rock climax, with Brian May\u2019s soaring guitar solo, contrasts its melancholic opening and theatrical middle section. Despite initial doubts from record labels, the song became a timeless classic, achieving renewed fame through films like Wayne\u2019s World and Bohemian Rhapsody (2018).",
